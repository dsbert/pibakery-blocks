Combined with the 'On Every Boot' block, this block allows you to run a VNC server on a designated port every time your Pi starts up. This block will only work if a VNC server is already installed, which you can use the 'Install VNC Server' block. If a port number less than 5901 is chosen, the port number used will be 5900 + the port you chose."
